# CaMS-Vis
### Cancer Mutational Signature Visualization

The construction of mutational catalogues are necessary for the analysis for mutational signatures for many genetically-associated diseases but are highly studies in cancer. Visualizations from variant called files are necessary for these analyses. CaMS-Vis is a tool for the visualization of mutational catalogues based on grouping into the 6 mutation classes and 96 mutation types from a binary variant call format (bcf) file.
